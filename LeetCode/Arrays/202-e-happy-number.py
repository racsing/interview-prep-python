Approach 1: Detect Cycles with a HashSet

Time complexity :  O(243â‹…3 + logn + loglogn + logloglogn)... = O(logn)
Space Complexity : O(logn)

Finding the next value for a given number has a cost of O(logn) because we are processing each digit in the number,
and the number of digits in a number is given by logn.
